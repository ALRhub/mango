### 📘 Overview

MaNGO introduces a **Meta Neural Graph Operator** that enables **Graph Network Simulators** to adapt across different physical systems.  
The method combines **meta-learning** with a **neural operator based architecture**, allowing the simulator to generalize to unseen material properties and predict full trajectories efficiently and stably.

### Installation
We use `uv` as our environment manager. To set up the environment, run:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment (recommended)
uv venv
uv sync
```
